_An Anthro-Historical Artistâ€™s Journey Through the History of a River

### Introduction

Secret History is a journey to discover and collect the lost narratives of people who live and work on the river from the deck of a recreated shantyboat and present these stories through web-based digital archives and a touring art installation.

This is the source for the ongoing development of the interactive web documentary for the project.
